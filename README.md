# Restaurent-Management-System
Restaurent Management System for  2nd Year ITP project

Through this project, the main goal was handling all the functionalities of High Garden restaurant via a web application instead of a previously used document-driven system. In the beginning, the restaurant owners faced many problems because of a lack of security in storing their data and the way of maintaining the restaurant's day-to-day tasks. So, the owners hoping for a well-designed web and computer-based application under an online platform to be more sufficient in their business. As a result, reducing human errors and manual effects this restaurant management system is implemented with the main 7 functionalities. Not only for the finance, order management, attendance, and leaves, even the inventory, supplier management also can be accessible and control through this web application now. Apart from storing restaurant details, this system provides facilities for clients to order preferred food items and deliver them via an online platform. Both administrators and clients can use this web application and the attractive and simple UI supply more user-friendliness when using this web application.
